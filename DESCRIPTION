Description: A header-only C++ library is provided with support
 for dates, time zones, ISO weeks, Julian dates, and Islamic dates.
 'date' offers extensive date and time functionality for the C++11,
 C++14 and C++17 standards and was written by Howard Hinnant and released 
 under the MIT license. A slightly modified version has been accepted
 (along with 'tz.h') as part of C++20. This package regroups all
 header files from the upstream repository by Howard Hinnant so that
 other R packages can use them in their C++ code. At present, few of
 the types have explicit 'Rcpp' wrappers though these may be added as
 needed.
